alices adventures in wonderlandlewis carrollthe millennium fulcrum edition chapter idown the rabbitholealice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank and of having nothing to do once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading but it had no pictures or conversations in it and what is the use of a book thought alice without pictures or conversationso she was considering in her own mind as well as she could for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid whether the pleasure of making a daisychain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies when suddenly a white rabbit with pink eyes ran close by herthere was nothing so very remarkable in that nor did alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the rabbit say to itself oh dear oh dear i shall be late when she thought it over afterwards it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this but at the time it all seemed quite natural but when the rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoatpocket and looked at it and then hurried on alice started to her feet for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoatpocket or a watch to take out of it and burning with curiosity she ran across the field after it and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbithole under the hedgein another moment down went alice after it never once considering how in the world she was to get out againthe rabbithole went straight on like a tunnel for some way and then dipped suddenly down so suddenly that alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep welleither the well was very deep or she fell very slowly for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next first she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to but it was too dark to see anything then she looked at the sides of the well and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and bookshelves here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs she took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed it was labelled orange marmalade but to her great disappointment it was empty she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past itwell thought alice to herself after such a fall as this i shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs how brave theyll all think me at home why i wouldnt say anything about it even if i fell off the top of the house which was very likely truedown down down would the fall never come to an end i wonder how many miles ive fallen by this time she said aloud i must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth let me see that would be four thousand miles down i think for you see alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom and though this was not a very good opportunity for showing off her knowledge as there was no one to listen to her still it was good practice to say it over yes thats about the right distancebut then i wonder what latitude or longitude ive got to alice had no idea what latitude was or longitude either but thought they were nice grand words to saypresently she began again i wonder if i shall fall right through the earth how funny itll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward the antipathies i think she was rather glad there was no one listening this time as it didnt sound at all the right word but i shall have to ask them what the name of the country is you know please maam is this new zealand or australia and she tried to curtsey as she spokefancy curtseying as youre falling through the air do you think you could manage it and what an ignorant little girl shell think me for asking no itll never do to ask perhaps i shall see it written up somewheredown down down there was nothing else to do so alice soon began talking again dinahll miss me very much tonight i should think dinah was the cat i hope theyll remember her saucer of milk at teatime dinah my dear i wish you were down here with me there are no mice in the air im afraid but you might catch a bat and thats very like a mouse you know but do cats eat bats i wonder and here alice began to get rather sleepy and went on saying to herself in a dreamy sort of way do cats eat bats do cats eat bats and sometimes do bats eat cats for you see as she couldnt answer either question it didnt much matter which way she put it she felt that she was dozing off and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with dinah and saying to her very earnestly now dinah tell me the truth did you ever eat a bat when suddenly thump thump down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves and the fall was overalice was not a bit hurt and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment she looked up but it was all dark overhead before her was another long passage and the white rabbit was still in sight hurrying down it there was not a moment to be lost away went alice like the wind and was just in time to hear it say as it turned a corner oh my ears and whiskers how late its getting she was close behind it when she turned the corner but the rabbit was no longer to be seen she found herself in a long low hall which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roofthere were doors all round the hall but they were all locked and when alice had been all the way down one side and up the other trying every door she walked sadly down the middle wondering how she was ever to get out againsuddenly she came upon a little threelegged table all made of solid glass there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key and alices first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall but alas either the locks were too large or the key was too small but at any rate it would not open any of them however on the second time round she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high she tried the little golden key in the lock and to her great delight it fittedalice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage not much larger than a rathole she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw how she longed to get out of that dark hall and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains but she could not even get her head though the doorway and even if my head would go through thought poor alice it would be of very little use without my shoulders oh how i wish i could shut up like a telescope i think i could if i only know how to begin for you see so many outoftheway things had happened lately that alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossiblethere seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door so she went back to the table half hoping she might find another key on it or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes this time she found a little bottle on it which certainly was not here before said alice and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label with the words drink me beautifully printed on it in large lettersit was all very well to say drink me but the wise little alice was not going to do that in a hurry no ill look first she said and see whether its marked poison or not for she had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things all because they would not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them such as that a redhot poker will burn you if you hold it too long and that if you cut your finger very deeply with a knife it usually bleeds and she had never forgotten that if you drink much from a bottle marked poison it is almost certain to disagree with you sooner or laterhowever this bottle was not marked poison so alice ventured to taste it and finding it very nice it had in fact a sort of mixed flavour of cherrytart custard pineapple roast turkey toffee and hot buttered toast she very soon finished it off                                                       what a curious feeling said alice i must be shutting up like a telescopeand so it was indeed she was now only ten inches high and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden first however she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further she felt a little nervous about this for it might end you know said alice to herself in my going out altogether like a candle i wonder what i should be like then and she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out for she could not remember ever having seen such a thingafter a while finding that nothing more happened she decided on going into the garden at once but alas for poor alice when she got to the door she found she had forgotten the little golden key and when she went back to the table for it she found she could not possibly reach it she could see it quite plainly through the glass and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table but it was too slippery and when she had tired herself out with trying the poor little thing sat down and criedcome theres no use in crying like that said alice to herself rather sharply i advise you to leave off this minute she generally gave herself very good advice though she very seldom followed it and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people but its no use now thought poor alice to pretend to be two people why theres hardly enough of me left to make one respectable personsoon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table she opened it and found in it a very small cake on which the words eat me were beautifully marked in currants well ill eat it said alice and if it makes me grow larger i can reach the key and if it makes me grow smaller i can creep under the door so either way ill get into the garden and i dont care which happensshe ate a little bit and said anxiously to herself which way which way holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size to be sure this generally happens when one eats cake but alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but outoftheway things to happen that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common wayso she set to work and very soon finished off the cake                                                       chapter iithe pool of tearscuriouser and curiouser cried alice she was so much surprised that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good english now im opening out like the largest telescope that ever was goodbye feet for when she looked down at her feet they seemed to be almost out of sight they were getting so far off oh my poor little feet i wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now dears im sure i shant be able i shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you you must manage the best way you can but i must be kind to them thought alice or perhaps they wont walk the way i want to go let me see ill give them a new pair of boots every christmasand she went on planning to herself how she would manage it they must go by the carrier she thought and how funny itll seem sending presents to ones own feet and how odd the directions will look    alices right foot esq    hearthrug    near the fender    with alices loveoh dear what nonsense im talkingjust then her head struck against the roof of the hall in fact she was now more than nine feet high and she at once took up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden doorpoor alice it was as much as she could do lying down on one side to look through into the garden with one eye but to get through was more hopeless than ever she sat down and began to cry againyou ought to be ashamed of yourself said alice a great girl like you she might well say this to go on crying in this way stop this moment i tell you but she went on all the same shedding gallons of tears until there was a large pool all round her about four inches deep and reaching half down the hallafter a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming it was the white rabbit returning splendidly dressed with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other he came trotting along in a great hurry muttering to himself as he came oh the duchess the duchess oh wont she be savage if ive kept her waiting alice felt so desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one so when the rabbit came near her she began in a low timid voice if you please sir the rabbit started violently dropped the white kid gloves and the fan and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could goalice took up the fan and gloves and as the hall was very hot she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking dear dear how queer everything is today and yesterday things went on just as usual i wonder if ive been changed in the night let me think was i the same when i got up this morning i almost think i can remember feeling a little different but if im not the same the next question is who in the world am i ah thats the great puzzle and she began thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as herself to see if she could have been changed for any of themim sure im not ada she said for her hair goes in such long ringlets and mine doesnt go in ringlets at all and im sure i cant be mabel for i know all sorts of things and she oh she knows such a very little besides shes she and im i andoh dear how puzzling it all is ill try if i know all the things i used to know let me see four times five is twelve and four times six is thirteen and four times seven isoh dear i shall never get to twenty at that rate however the multiplication table doesnt signify lets try geography london is the capital of paris and paris is the capital of rome and romeno thats all wrong im certain i must have been changed for mabel ill try and say how doth the little and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons and began to repeat it but her voice sounded hoarse and strange and the words did not come the same as they used to do    how doth the little crocodile    improve his shining tail    and pour the waters of the nile    on every golden scale    how cheerfully he seems to grin    how neatly spread his claws    and welcome little fishes in    with gently smiling jawsim sure those are not the right words said poor alice and her eyes filled with tears again as she went on i must be mabel after all and i shall have to go and live in that poky little house and have next to no toys to play with and oh ever so many lessons to learn no ive made up my mind about it if im mabel ill stay down here itll be no use their putting their heads down and saying come up again dear i shall only look up and say who am i then tell me that first and then if i like being that person ill come up if not ill stay down here till im somebody elsebut oh dear cried alice with a sudden burst of tears i do wish they would put their heads down i am so very tired of being all alone hereas she said this she looked down at her hands and was surprised to see that she had put on one of the rabbits little white kid gloves while she was talking how can i have done that she thought i must be growing small again she got up and went to the table to measure herself by it and found that as nearly as she could guess she was now about two feet high and was going on shrinking rapidly she soon found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding and she dropped it hastily just in time to avoid shrinking away altogetherthat was a narrow escape said alice a good deal frightened at the sudden change but very glad to find herself still in existence and now for the garden and she ran with all speed back to the little door but alas the little door was shut again and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as before and things are worse than ever thought the poor child for i never was so small as this before never and i declare its too bad that it isas she said these words her foot slipped and in another moment splash she was up to her chin in salt water her first idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea and in that case i can go back by railway she said to herself alice had been to the seaside once in her life and had come to the general conclusion that wherever you go to on the english coast you find a number of bathing machines in the sea some children digging in the sand with wooden spades then a row of lodging houses and behind them a railway station however she soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet highi wish i hadnt cried so much said alice as she swam about trying to find her way out i shall be punished for it now i suppose by being drowned in my own tears that will be a queer thing to be sure however everything is queer todayjust then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off and she swam nearer to make out what it was at first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus but then she remembered how small she was now and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herselfwould it be of any use now thought alice to speak to this mouse everything is so outoftheway down here that i should think very likely it can talk at any rate theres no harm in trying so she began o mouse do you know the way out of this pool i am very tired of swimming about here o mouse alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse she had never done such a thing before but she remembered having seen in her brothers latin grammar a mouseof a mouseto a mousea mouseo mouse the mouse looked at her rather inquisitively and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes but it said nothingperhaps it doesnt understand english thought alice i daresay its a french mouse come over with william the conqueror for with all her knowledge of history alice had no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened so she began again ou est ma chatte which was the first sentence in her french lessonbook the mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water and seemed to quiver all over with fright oh i beg your pardon cried alice hastily afraid that she had hurt the poor animals feelings i quite forgot you didnt like catsnot like cats cried the mouse in a shrill passionate voice would you like cats if you were mewell perhaps not said alice in a soothing tone dont be angry about it and yet i wish i could show you our cat dinah i think youd take a fancy to cats if you could only see her she is such a dear quiet thing alice went on half to herself as she swam lazily about in the pool and she sits purring so nicely by the fire licking her paws and washing her faceand she is such a nice soft thing to nurseand shes such a capital one for catching miceoh i beg your pardon cried alice again for this time the mouse was bristling all over and she felt certain it must be really offended we wont talk about her any more if youd rather notwe indeed cried the mouse who was trembling down to the end of his tail as if i would talk on such a subject our family always hated cats nasty low vulgar things dont let me hear the name againi wont indeed said alice in a great hurry to change the subject of conversation are youare you fondofof dogs the mouse did not answer so alice went on eagerly there is such a nice little dog near our house i should like to show you a little brighteyed terrier you know with oh such long curly brown hair and itll fetch things when you throw them and itll sit up and beg for its dinner and all sorts of thingsi cant remember half of themand it belongs to a farmer you know and he says its so useful its worth a hundred pounds he says it kills all the rats andoh dear cried alice in a sorrowful tone im afraid ive offended it again for the mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go and making quite a commotion in the pool as it wentso she called softly after it mouse dear do come back again and we wont talk about cats or dogs either if you dont like them when the mouse heard this it turned round and swam slowly back to her its face was quite pale with passion alice thought and it said in a low trembling voice let us get to the shore and then ill tell you my history and youll understand why it is i hate cats and dogsit was high time to go for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and animals that had fallen into it there were a duck and a dodo a lory and an eaglet and several other curious creatures alice led the way and the whole party swam to the shorechapter iiia caucusrace and a long talethey were indeed a queerlooking party that assembled on the bankthe birds with draggled feathers the animals with their fur clinging close to them and all dripping wet cross and uncomfortablethe first question of course was how to get dry again they had a consultation about this and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural to alice to find herself talking familiarly with them as if she had known them all her life indeed she had quite a long argument with the lory who at last turned sulky and would only say i am older than you and must know better and this alice would not allow without knowing how old it was and as the lory positively refused to tell its age there was no more to be saidat last the mouse who seemed to be a person of authority among them called out sit down all of you and listen to me ill soon make you dry enough they all sat down at once in a large ring with the mouse in the middle alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it for she felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soonahem said the mouse with an important air are you all ready this is the driest thing i know silence all round if you please william the conqueror whose cause was favoured by the pope was soon submitted to by the english who wanted leaders and had been of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest edwin and morcar the earls of mercia and northumbriaugh said the lory with a shiveri beg your pardon said the mouse frowning but very politely did you speaknot i said the lory hastilyi thought you did said the mouse i proceed edwin and morcar the earls of mercia and northumbria declared for him and even stigand the patriotic archbishop of canterbury found it advisablefound what said the duckfound it the mouse replied rather crossly of course you know what it meansi know what it means well enough when i find a thing said the duck its generally a frog or a worm the question is what did the archbishop findthe mouse did not notice this question but hurriedly went on found it advisable to go with edgar atheling to meet william and offer him the crown williams conduct at first was moderate but the insolence of his normans how are you getting on now my dear it continued turning to alice as it spokeas wet as ever said alice in a melancholy tone it doesnt seem to dry me at allin that case said the dodo solemnly rising to its feet i move that the meeting adjourn for the immediate adoption of more energetic remediesspeak english said the eaglet i dont know the meaning of half those long words and whats more i dont believe you do either and the eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile some of the other birds tittered audiblywhat i was going to say said the dodo in an offended tone was that the best thing to get us dry would be a caucusracewhat is a caucusrace said alice not that she wanted much to know but the dodo had paused as if it thought that somebody ought to speak and no one else seemed inclined to say anythingwhy said the dodo the best way to explain it is to do it and as you might like to try the thing yourself some winter day i will tell you how the dodo managed itfirst it marked out a racecourse in a sort of circle the exact shape doesnt matter it said and then all the party were placed along the course here and there there was no one two three and away but they began running when they liked and left off when they liked so that it was not easy to know when the race was over however when they had been running half an hour or so and were quite dry again the dodo suddenly called out the race is over and they all crowded round it panting and asking but who has wonthis question the dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its forehead the position in which you usually see shakespeare in the pictures of him while the rest waited in silence at last the dodo said everybody has won and all must have prizesbut who is to give the prizes quite a chorus of voices askedwhy she of course said the dodo pointing to alice with one finger and the whole party at once crowded round her calling out in a confused way prizes prizesalice had no idea what to do and in despair she put her hand in her pocket and pulled out a box of comfits luckily the salt water had not got into it and handed them round as prizes there was exactly one apiece all roundbut she must have a prize herself you know said the mouseof course the dodo replied very gravely what else have you got in your pocket he went on turning to aliceonly a thimble said alice sadlyhand it over here said the dodothen they all crowded round her once more while the dodo solemnly presented the thimble saying we beg your acceptance of this elegant thimble and when it had finished this short speech they all cheeredalice thought the whole thing very absurd but they all looked so grave that she did not dare to laugh and as she could not think of anything to say she simply bowed and took the thimble looking as solemn as she couldthe next thing was to eat the comfits this caused some noise and confusion as the large birds complained that they could not taste theirs and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back however it was over at last and they sat down again in a ring and begged the mouse to tell them something moreyou promised to tell me your history you know said alice and why it is you hatec and d she added in a whisper half afraid that it would be offended againmine is a long and a sad tale said the mouse turning to alice and sighingit is a long tail certainly said alice looking down with wonder at the mouses tail but why do you call it sad and she kept on puzzling about it while the mouse was speaking so that her idea of the tale was something like thisfury said to a mouse that he met in the house let us both go to law i will prosecute you come ill take no denial we must have a trial for really this morning ive nothing to do said the mouse to the cur such a trial dear sir with no jury or judge would be wasting our breath ill be judge ill be jury said cunning old fury ill try the whole cause and condemn you to deathyou are not attending said the mouse to alice severely what are you thinking ofi beg your pardon said alice very humbly you had got to the fifth bend i thinki had not cried the mouse sharply and very angrilya knot said alice always ready to make herself useful and looking anxiously about her oh do let me help to undo iti shall do nothing of the sort said the mouse getting up and walking away you insult me by talking such nonsensei didnt mean it pleaded poor alice but youre so easily offended you knowthe mouse only growled in replyplease come back and finish your story alice called after it and the others all joined in chorus yes please do but the mouse only shook its head impatiently and walked a little quickerwhat a pity it wouldnt stay sighed the lory as soon as it was quite out of sight and an old crab took the opportunity of saying to her daughter ah my dear let this be a lesson to you never to lose your temper hold your tongue ma said the young crab a little snappishly youre enough to try the patience of an oysteri wish i had our dinah here i know i do said alice aloud addressing nobody in particular shed soon fetch it backand who is dinah if i might venture to ask the question said the loryalice replied eagerly for she was always ready to talk about her pet dinahs our cat and shes such a capital one for catching mice you cant think and oh i wish you could see her after the birds why shell eat a little bird as soon as look at itthis speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party some of the birds hurried off at once one old magpie began wrapping itself up very carefully remarking i really must be getting home the nightair doesnt suit my throat and a canary called out in a trembling voice to its children come away my dears its high time you were all in bed on various pretexts they all moved off and alice was soon left alonei wish i hadnt mentioned dinah she said to herself in a melancholy tone nobody seems to like her down here and im sure shes the best cat in the world oh my dear dinah i wonder if i shall ever see you any more and here poor alice began to cry again for she felt very lonely and lowspirited in a little while however she again heard a little pattering of footsteps in the distance and she looked up eagerly half hoping that the mouse had changed his mind and was coming back to finish his storychapter ivthe rabbit sends in a little billit was the white rabbit trotting slowly back again and looking anxiously about as it went as if it had lost something and she heard it muttering to itself the duchess the duchess oh my dear paws oh my fur and whiskers shell get me executed as sure as ferrets are ferrets where can i have dropped them i wonder alice guessed in a moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves and she very goodnaturedly began hunting about for them but they were nowhere to be seeneverything seemed to have changed since her swim in the pool and the great hall with the glass table and the little door had vanished completelyvery soon the rabbit noticed alice as she went hunting about and called out to her in an angry tone why mary ann what are you doing out here run home this moment and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan quick now and alice was so much frightened that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to without trying to explain the mistake it had madehe took me for his housemaid she said to herself as she ran how surprised hell be when he finds out who i am but id better take him his fan and glovesthat is if i can find them as she said this she came upon a neat little house on the door of which was a bright brass plate with the name w rabbit engraved upon it she went in without knocking and hurried upstairs in great fear lest she should meet the real mary ann and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and gloveshow queer it seems alice said to herself to be going messages for a rabbit i suppose dinahll be sending me on messages next and she began fancying the sort of thing that would happen miss alice come here directly and get ready for your walk coming in a minute nurse but ive got to see that the mouse doesnt get out only i dont think alice went on that theyd let dinah stop in the house if it began ordering people about like thatby this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table in the window and on it as she had hoped a fan and two or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves and was just going to leave the room when her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking glass there was no label this time with the words drink me but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips i know something interesting is sure to happen she said to herself whenever i eat or drink anything so ill just see what this bottle does i do hope itll make me grow large again for really im quite tired of being such a tiny little thingit did so indeed and much sooner than she had expected before she had drunk half the bottle she found her head pressing against the ceiling and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken she hastily put down the bottle saying to herself thats quite enoughi hope i shant grow any moreas it is i cant get out at the doori do wish i hadnt drunk quite so muchalas it was too late to wish that she went on growing and growing and very soon had to kneel down on the floor in another minute there was not even room for this and she tried the effect of lying down with one elbow against the door and the other arm curled round her head still she went on growing and as a last resource she put one arm out of the window and one foot up the chimney and said to herself now i can do no more whatever happens what will become of meluckily for alice the little magic bottle had now had its full effect and she grew no larger still it was very uncomfortable and as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room again no wonder she felt unhappyit was much pleasanter at home thought poor alice when one wasnt always growing larger and smaller and being ordered about by mice and rabbits i almost wish i hadnt gone down that rabbitholeand yetand yetits rather curious you know this sort of life i do wonder what can have happened to me when i used to read fairytales i fancied that kind of thing never happened and now here i am in the middle of one there ought to be a book written about me that there ought and when i grow up ill write onebut im grown up now she added in a sorrowful tone at least theres no room to grow up any more herebut then thought alice shall i never get any older than i am now thatll be a comfort one waynever to be an old woman but thenalways to have lessons to learn oh i shouldnt like thatoh you foolish alice she answered herself how can you learn lessons in here why theres hardly room for you and no room at all for any lessonbooksand so she went on taking first one side and then the other and making quite a conversation of it altogether but after a few minutes she heard a voice outside and stopped to listenmary ann mary ann said the voice fetch me my gloves this moment then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs alice knew it was the rabbit coming to look for her and she trembled till she shook the house quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large as the rabbit and had no reason to be afraid of itpresently the rabbit came up to the door and tried to open it but as the door opened inwards and alices elbow was pressed hard against it that attempt proved a failure alice heard it say to itself then ill go round and get in at the windowthat you wont thought alice and after waiting till she fancied she heard the rabbit just under the window she suddenly spread out her hand and made a snatch in the air she did not get hold of anything but she heard a little shriek and a fall and a crash of broken glass from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a cucumberframe or something of the sortnext came an angry voicethe rabbitspat pat where are you and then a voice she had never heard before sure then im here digging for apples yer honourdigging for apples indeed said the rabbit angrily here come and help me out of this sounds of more broken glassnow tell me pat whats that in the windowsure its an arm yer honour he pronounced it arruman arm you goose who ever saw one that size why it fills the whole windowsure it does yer honour but its an arm for all thatwell its got no business there at any rate go and take it awaythere was a long silence after this and alice could only hear whispers now and then such as sure i dont like it yer honour at all at all do as i tell you you coward and at last she spread out her hand again and made another snatch in the air this time there were two little shrieks and more sounds of broken glass what a number of cucumberframes there must be thought alice i wonder what theyll do next as for pulling me out of the window i only wish they could im sure i dont want to stay in here any longershe waited for some time without hearing anything more at last came a rumbling of little cartwheels and the sound of a good many voices all talking together she made out the words wheres the other ladderwhy i hadnt to bring but one bills got the otherbill fetch it here ladhere put em up at this cornerno tie em together firstthey dont reach half high enough yetoh theyll do well enough dont be particular here bill catch hold of this ropewill the roof bearmind that loose slateoh its coming down heads below a loud crashnow who did thatit was bill i fancywhos to go down the chimneynay i shant you do itthat i wont thenbills to go downhere bill the master says youre to go down the chimneyoh so bills got to come down the chimney has he said alice to herself shy they seem to put everything upon bill i wouldnt be in bills place for a good deal this fireplace is narrow to be sure but i think i can kick a littleshe drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could and waited till she heard a little animal she couldnt guess of what sort it was scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her then saying to herself this is bill she gave one sharp kick and waited to see what would happen nextthe first thing she heard was a general chorus of there goes bill then the rabbits voice alongcatch him you by the hedge then silence and then another confusion of voiceshold up his headbrandy nowdont choke himhow was it old fellow what happened to you tell us all about itlast came a little feeble squeaking voice thats bill thought alice well i hardly knowno more thank ye im better nowbut im a deal too flustered to tell youall i know is something comes at me like a jackinthebox and up i goes like a skyrocketso you did old fellow said the otherswe must burn the house down said the rabbits voice and alice called out as loud as she could if you do ill set dinah at youthere was a dead silence instantly and alice thought to herself i wonder what they will do next if they had any sense theyd take the roof off after a minute or two they began moving about again and alice heard the rabbit say a barrowful will do to begin witha barrowful of what thought alice but she had not long to doubt for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the window and some of them hit her in the face ill put a stop to this she said to herself and shouted out youd better not do that again which produced another dead silencealice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor and a bright idea came into her head if i eat one of these cakes she thought its sure to make some change in my size and as it cant possibly make me larger it must make me smaller i supposeso she swallowed one of the cakes and was delighted to find that she began shrinking directly as soon as she was small enough to get through the door she ran out of the house and found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside the poor little lizard bill was in the middle being held up by two guineapigs who were giving it something out of a bottle they all made a rush at alice the moment she appeared but she ran off as hard as she could and soon found herself safe in a thick woodthe first thing ive got to do said alice to herself as she wandered about in the wood is to grow to my right size again and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden i think that will be the best planit sounded an excellent plan no doubt and very neatly and simply arranged the only difficulty was that she had not the smallest idea how to set about it and while she was peering about anxiously among the trees a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a great hurryan enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes and feebly stretching out one paw trying to touch her poor little thing said alice in a coaxing tone and she tried hard to whistle to it but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be hungry in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxinghardly knowing what she did she picked up a little bit of stick and held it out to the puppy whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off all its feet at once with a yelp of delight and rushed at the stick and made believe to worry it then alice dodged behind a great thistle to keep herself from being run over and the moment she appeared on the other side the puppy made another rush at the stick and tumbled head over heels in its hurry to get hold of it then alice thinking it was very like having a game of play with a carthorse and expecting every moment to be trampled under its feet ran round the thistle again then the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick running a very little way forwards each time and a long way back and barking hoarsely all the while till at last it sat down a good way off panting with its tongue hanging out of its mouth and its great eyes half shutthis seemed to alice a good opportunity for making her escape so she set off at once and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath and till the puppys bark sounded quite faint in the distanceand yet what a dear little puppy it was said alice as she leant against a buttercup to rest herself and fanned herself with one of the leaves i should have liked teaching it tricks very much ifif id only been the right size to do it oh dear id nearly forgotten that ive got to grow up again let me seehow is it to be managed i suppose i ought to eat or drink something or other but the great question is whatthe great question certainly was what alice looked all round her at the flowers and the blades of grass but she did not see anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances there was a large mushroom growing near her about the same height as herself and when she had looked under it and on both sides of it and behind it it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what was on the top of itshe stretched herself up on tiptoe and peeped over the edge of the mushroom and her eyes immediately met those of a large caterpillar that was sitting on the top with its arms folded quietly smoking a long hookah and taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything elsechapter vadvice from a caterpillarthe caterpillar and alice looked at each other for some time in silence at last the caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and addressed her in a languid sleepy voicewho are you said the caterpillarthis was not an encouraging opening for a conversation alice replied rather shyly ii hardly know sir just at present at least i know who i was when i got up this morning but i think i must have been changed several times since thenwhat do you mean by that said the caterpillar sternly explain yourselfi cant explain myself im afraid sir said alice because im not myself you seei dont see said the caterpillarim afraid i cant put it more clearly alice replied very politely for i cant understand it myself to begin with and being so many different sizes in a day is very confusingit isnt said the caterpillarwell perhaps you havent found it so yet said alice but when you have to turn into a chrysalisyou will some day you knowand then after that into a butterfly i should think youll feel it a little queer wont younot a bit said the caterpillarwell perhaps your feelings may be different said alice all i know is it would feel very queer to meyou said the caterpillar contemptuously who are youwhich brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation alice felt a little irritated at the caterpillars making such very short remarks and she drew herself up and said very gravely i think you ought to tell me who you are firstwhy said the caterpillarhere was another puzzling question and as alice could not think of any good reason and as the caterpillar seemed to be in a very unpleasant state of mind she turned awaycome back the caterpillar called after her ive something important to saythis sounded promising certainly alice turned and came back againkeep your temper said the caterpillaris that all said alice swallowing down her anger as well as she couldno said the caterpillaralice thought she might as well wait as she had nothing else to do and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing for some minutes it puffed away without speaking but at last it unfolded its arms took the hookah out of its mouth again and said so you think youre changed do youim afraid i am sir said alice i cant remember things as i usedand i dont keep the same size for ten minutes togethercant remember what things said the caterpillarwell ive tried to say how doth the little busy bee but it all came different alice replied in a very melancholy voicerepeat you are old father william said the caterpillaralice folded her hands and beganyou are old father william the young man said and your hair has become very white and yet you incessantly stand on your head do you think at your age it is rightin my youth father william replied to his son i feared it might injure the brain but now that im perfectly sure i have none why i do it again and againyou are old said the youth as i mentioned before and have grown most uncommonly fat yet you turned a backsomersault in at the door pray what is the reason of thatin my youth said the sage as he shook his grey locks i kept all my limbs very supple by the use of this ointmentone shilling the box allow me to sell you a coupleyou are old said the youth and your jaws are too weak for anything tougher than suet yet you finished the goose with the bones and the beak pray how did you manage to do itin my youth said his father i took to the law and argued each case with my wife and the muscular strength which it gave to my jaw has lasted the rest of my lifeyou are old said the youth one would hardly suppose that your eye was as steady as ever yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose what made you so awfully cleveri have answered three questions and that is enough said his father dont give yourself airs do you think i can listen all day to such stuff be off or ill kick you down stairsthat is not said right said the caterpillarnot quite right im afraid said alice timidly some of the words have got alteredit is wrong from beginning to end said the caterpillar decidedly and there was silence for some minutesthe caterpillar was the first to speakwhat size do you want to be it askedoh im not particular as to size alice hastily replied only one doesnt like changing so often you knowi dont know said the caterpillaralice said nothing she had never been so much contradicted in her life before and she felt that she was losing her temperare you content now said the caterpillarwell i should like to be a little larger sir if you wouldnt mind said alice three inches is such a wretched height to beit is a very good height indeed said the caterpillar angrily rearing itself upright as it spoke it was exactly three inches highbut im not used to it pleaded poor alice in a piteous tone and she thought of herself i wish the creatures wouldnt be so easily offendedyoull get used to it in time said the caterpillar and it put the hookah into its mouth and began smoking againthis time alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again in a minute or two the caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and yawned once or twice and shook itself then it got down off the mushroom and crawled away in the grass merely remarking as it went one side will make you grow taller and the other side will make you grow shorterone side of what the other side of what thought alice to herselfof the mushroom said the caterpillar just as if she had asked it aloud and in another moment it was out of sightalice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute trying to make out which were the two sides of it and as it was perfectly round she found this a very difficult question however at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go and broke off a bit of the edge with each handand now which is which she said to herself and nibbled a little of the righthand bit to try the effect the next moment she felt a violent blow underneath her chin it had struck her footshe was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change but she felt that there was no time to be lost as she was shrinking rapidly so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit her chin was pressed so closely against her foot that there was hardly room to open her mouth but she did it at last and managed to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit    come my heads free at last said alice in a tone of delight which changed into alarm in another moment when she found that her shoulders were nowhere to be found all she could see when she looked down was an immense length of neck which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay far below herwhat can all that green stuff be said alice and where have my shoulders got to and oh my poor hands how is it i cant see you she was moving them about as she spoke but no result seemed to follow except a little shaking among the distant green leavesas there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head she tried to get her head down to them and was delighted to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction like a serpent she had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag and was going to dive in among the leaves which she found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which she had been wandering when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a hurry a large pigeon had flown into her face and was beating her violently with its wingsserpent screamed the pigeonim not a serpent said alice indignantly let me aloneserpent i say again repeated the pigeon but in a more subdued tone and added with a kind of sob ive tried every way and nothing seems to suit themi havent the least idea what youre talking about said aliceive tried the roots of trees and ive tried banks and ive tried hedges the pigeon went on without attending to her but those serpents theres no pleasing themalice was more and more puzzled but she thought there was no use in saying anything more till the pigeon had finishedas if it wasnt trouble enough hatching the eggs said the pigeon but i must be on the lookout for serpents night and day why i havent had a wink of sleep these three weeksim very sorry youve been annoyed said alice who was beginning to see its meaningand just as id taken the highest tree in the wood continued the pigeon raising its voice to a shriek and just as i was thinking i should be free of them at last they must needs come wriggling down from the sky ugh serpentbut im not a serpent i tell you said alice im aim awell what are you said the pigeon i can see youre trying to invent somethingiim a little girl said alice rather doubtfully as she remembered the number of changes she had gone through that daya likely story indeed said the pigeon in a tone of the deepest contempt ive seen a good many little girls in my time but never one with such a neck as that no no youre a serpent and theres no use denying it i suppose youll be telling me next that you never tasted an eggi have tasted eggs certainly said alice who was a very truthful child but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do you knowi dont believe it said the pigeon but if they do why then theyre a kind of serpent thats all i can saythis was such a new idea to alice that she was quite silent for a minute or two which gave the pigeon the opportunity of adding youre looking for eggs i know that well enough and what does it matter to me whether youre a little girl or a serpentit matters a good deal to me said alice hastily but im not looking for eggs as it happens and if i was i shouldnt want yours i dont like them rawwell be off then said the pigeon in a sulky tone as it settled down again into its nest alice crouched down among the trees as well as she could for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches and every now and then she had to stop and untwist it after a while she remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands and she set to work very carefully nibbling first at one and then at the other and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter until she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual heightit was so long since she had been anything near the right size that it felt quite strange at first but she got used to it in a few minutes and began talking to herself as usual come theres half my plan done now how puzzling all these changes are im never sure what im going to be from one minute to another however ive got back to my right size the next thing is to get into that beautiful gardenhow is that to be done i wonder as she said this she came suddenly upon an open place with a little house in it about four feet high whoever lives there thought alice itll never do to come upon them this size why i should frighten them out of their wits so she began nibbling at the righthand bit again and did not venture to go near the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches highchapter vipig and pepperfor a minute or two she stood looking at the house and wondering what to do next when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the woodshe considered him to be a footman because he was in livery otherwise judging by his face only she would have called him a fishand rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles it was opened by another footman in livery with a round face and large eyes like a frog and both footmen alice noticed had powdered hair that curled all over their heads she felt very curious to know what it was all about and crept a little way out of the wood to listenthe fishfootman began by producing from under his arm a great letter nearly as large as himself and this he handed over to the other saying in a solemn tone for the duchess an invitation from the queen to play croquet the frogfootman repeated in the same solemn tone only changing the order of the words a little from the queen an invitation for the duchess to play croquetthen they both bowed low and their curls got entangled togetheralice laughed so much at this that she had to run back into the wood for fear of their hearing her and when she next peeped out the fishfootman was gone and the other was sitting on the ground near the door staring stupidly up into the skyalice went timidly up to the door and knockedtheres no sort of use in knocking said the footman and that for two reasons first because im on the same side of the door as you are secondly because theyre making such a noise inside no one could possibly hear you and certainly there was a most extraordinary noise going on withina constant howling and sneezing and every now and then a great crash as if a dish or kettle had been broken to piecesplease then said alice how am i to get inthere might be some sense in your knocking the footman went on without attending to her if we had the door between us for instance if you were inside you might knock and i could let you out you know he was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking and this alice thought decidedly uncivil but perhaps he cant help it she said to herself his eyes are so very nearly at the top of his head but at any rate he might answer questionshow am i to get in she repeated aloudi shall sit here the footman remarked till tomorrowat this moment the door of the house opened and a large plate came skimming out straight at the footmans head it just grazed his nose and broke to pieces against one of the trees behind himor next day maybe the footman continued in the same tone exactly as if nothing had happenedhow am i to get in asked alice again in a louder toneare you to get in at all said the footman thats the first question you knowit was no doubt only alice did not like to be told so its really dreadful she muttered to herself the way all the creatures argue its enough to drive one crazythe footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his remark with variations i shall sit here he said on and off for days and daysbut what am i to do said aliceanything you like said the footman and began whistlingoh theres no use in talking to him said alice desperately hes perfectly idiotic and she opened the door and went inthe door led right into a large kitchen which was full of smoke from one end to the other the duchess was sitting on a threelegged stool in the middle nursing a baby the cook was leaning over the fire stirring a large cauldron which seemed to be full of souptheres certainly too much pepper in that soup alice said to herself as well as she could for sneezingthere was certainly too much of it in the air even the duchess sneezed occasionally and as for the baby it was sneezing and howling alternately without a moments pause the only things in the kitchen that did not sneeze were the cook and a large cat which was sitting on the hearth and grinning from ear to earplease would you tell me said alice a little timidly for she was not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first why your cat grins like thatits a cheshire cat said the duchess and thats why pigshe said the last word with such sudden violence that alice quite jumped but she saw in another moment that it was addressed to the baby and not to her so she took courage and went on againi didnt know that cheshire cats always grinned in fact i didnt know that cats could grinthey all can said the duchess and most of em doi dont know of any that do alice said very politely feeling quite pleased to have got into a conversationyou dont know much said the duchess and thats a factalice did not at all like the tone of this remark and thought it would be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation while she was trying to fix on one the cook took the cauldron of soup off the fire and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at the duchess and the baby the fireirons came first then followed a shower of saucepans plates and dishes the duchess took no notice of them even when they hit her and the baby was howling so much already that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or notoh please mind what youre doing cried alice jumping up and down in an agony of terror oh there goes his precious nose as an unusually large saucepan flew close by it and very nearly carried it offif everybody minded their own business the duchess said in a hoarse growl the world would go round a deal faster than it doeswhich would not be an advantage said alice who felt very glad to get an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge just think of what work it would make with the day and night you see the earth takes twentyfour hours to turn round on its axistalking of axes said the duchess chop off her headalice glanced rather anxiously at the cook to see if she meant to take the hint but the cook was busily stirring the soup and seemed not to be listening so she went on again twentyfour hours i think or is it twelve ioh dont bother me said the duchess i never could abide figures and with that she began nursing her child again singing a sort of lullaby to it as she did so and giving it a violent shake at the end of every linespeak roughly to your little boyand beat him when he sneezeshe only does it to annoybecause he knows it teaseschorusin which the cook and the baby joinedwow wow wowwhile the duchess sang the second verse of the song she kept tossing the baby violently up and down and the poor little thing howled so that alice could hardly hear the wordsi speak severely to my boyi beat him when he sneezesfor he can thoroughly enjoythe pepper when he pleaseschoruswow wow wowhere you may nurse it a bit if you like the duchess said to alice flinging the baby at her as she spoke i must go and get ready to play croquet with the queen and she hurried out of the room the cook threw a fryingpan after her as she went out but it just missed heralice caught the baby with some difficulty as it was a queer shaped little creature and held out its arms and legs in all directions just like a starfish thought alice the poor little thing was snorting like a steamengine when she caught it and kept doubling itself up and straightening itself out again so that altogether for the first minute or two it was as much as she could do to hold itas soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it which was to twist it up into a sort of knot and then keep tight hold of its right ear and left foot so as to prevent its undoing itself she carried it out into the open air if i dont take this child away with me thought alice theyre sure to kill it in a day or two wouldnt it be murder to leave it behind she said the last words out loud and the little thing grunted in reply it had left off sneezing by this time dont grunt said alice thats not at all a proper way of expressing yourselfthe baby grunted again and alice looked very anxiously into its face to see what was the matter with it there could be no doubt that it had a very turnup nose much more like a snout than a real nose also its eyes were getting extremely small for a baby altogether alice did not like the look of the thing at all but perhaps it was only sobbing she thought and looked into its eyes again to see if there were any tearsno there were no tears if youre going to turn into a pig my dear said alice seriously ill have nothing more to do with you mind now the poor little thing sobbed again or grunted it was impossible to say which and they went on for some while in silencealice was just beginning to think to herself now what am i to do with this creature when i get it home when it grunted again so violently that she looked down into its face in some alarm this time there could be no mistake about it it was neither more nor less than a pig and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it furtherso she set the little creature down and felt quite relieved to see it trot away quietly into the wood if it had grown up she said to herself it would have made a dreadfully ugly child but it makes rather a handsome pig i think and she began thinking over other children she knew who might do very well as pigs and was just saying to herself if one only knew the right way to change them when she was a little startled by seeing the cheshire cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards offthe cat only grinned when it saw alice it looked good natured she thought still it had very long claws and a great many teeth so she felt that it ought to be treated with respectcheshire puss she began rather timidly as she did not at all know whether it would like the name however it only grinned a little wider come its pleased so far thought alice and she went on would you tell me please which way i ought to go from herethat depends a good deal on where you want to get to said the cati dont much care where said alicethen it doesnt matter which way you go said the catso long as i get somewhere alice added as an explanationoh youre sure to do that said the cat if you only walk long enoughalice felt that this could not be denied so she tried another question what sort of people live about herein that direction the cat said waving its right paw round lives a hatter and in that direction waving the other paw lives a march hare visit either you like theyre both madbut i dont want to go among mad people alice remarkedoh you cant help that said the cat were all mad here im mad youre madhow do you know im mad said aliceyou must be said the cat or you wouldnt have come herealice didnt think that proved it at all however she went on and how do you know that youre madto begin with said the cat a dogs not mad you grant thati suppose so said alicewell then the cat went on you see a dog growls when its angry and wags its tail when its pleased now i growl when im pleased and wag my tail when im angry therefore im madi call it purring not growling said alicecall it what you like said the cat do you play croquet with the queen todayi should like it very much said alice but i havent been invited yetyoull see me there said the cat and vanishedalice was not much surprised at this she was getting so used to queer things happening while she was looking at the place where it had been it suddenly appeared againbythebye what became of the baby said the cat id nearly forgotten to askit turned into a pig alice quietly said just as if it had come back in a natural wayi thought it would said the cat and vanished againalice waited a little half expecting to see it again but it did not appear and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in which the march hare was said to live ive seen hatters before she said to herself the march hare will be much the most interesting and perhaps as this is may it wont be raving madat least not so mad as it was in march as she said this she looked up and there was the cat again sitting on a branch of a treedid you say pig or fig said the cati said pig replied alice and i wish you wouldnt keep appearing and vanishing so suddenly you make one quite giddyall right said the cat and this time it vanished quite slowly beginning with the end of the tail and ending with the grin which remained some time after the rest of it had gonewell ive often seen a cat without a grin thought alice but a grin without a cat its the most curious thing i ever saw in my lifeshe had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of the march hare she thought it must be the right house because the chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur it was so large a house that she did not like to go nearer till she had nibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom and raised herself to about two feet high even then she walked up towards it rather timidly saying to herself suppose it should be raving mad after all i almost wish id gone to see the hatter insteadchapter viia mad teapartythere was a table set out under a tree in front of the house and the march hare and the hatter were having tea at it a dormouse was sitting between them fast asleep and the other two were using it as a cushion resting their elbows on it and talking over its head very uncomfortable for the dormouse thought alice only as its asleep i suppose it doesnt mindthe table was a large one but the three were all crowded together at one corner of it no room no room they cried out when they saw alice coming theres plenty of room said alice indignantly and she sat down in a large armchair at one end of the tablehave some wine the march hare said in an encouraging tonealice looked all round the table but there was nothing on it but tea i dont see any wine she remarkedthere isnt any said the march harethen it wasnt very civil of you to offer it said alice angrilyit wasnt very civil of you to sit down without being invited said the march harei didnt know it was your table said alice its laid for a great many more than threeyour hair wants cutting said the hatter he had been looking at alice for some time with great curiosity and this was his first speechyou should learn not to make personal remarks alice said with some severity its very rudethe hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this but all he said was why is a raven like a writingdeskcome we shall have some fun now thought alice im glad theyve begun asking riddlesi believe i can guess that she added alouddo you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it said the march hareexactly so said alicethen you should say what you mean the march hare went oni do alice hastily replied at leastat least i mean what i saythats the same thing you knownot the same thing a bit said the hatter you might just as well say that i see what i eat is the same thing as i eat what i seeyou might just as well say added the march hare that i like what i get is the same thing as i get what i likeyou might just as well say added the dormouse who seemed to be talking in his sleep that i breathe when i sleep is the same thing as i sleep when i breatheit is the same thing with you said the hatter and here the conversation dropped and the party sat silent for a minute while alice thought over all she could remember about ravens and writingdesks which wasnt muchthe hatter was the first to break the silence what day of the month is it he said turning to alice he had taken his watch out of his pocket and was looking at it uneasily shaking it every now and then and holding it to his earalice considered a little and then said the fourthtwo days wrong sighed the hatter i told you butter wouldnt suit the works he added looking angrily at the march hareit was the best butter the march hare meekly repliedyes but some crumbs must have got in as well the hatter grumbled you shouldnt have put it in with the breadknifethe march hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily then he dipped it into his cup of tea and looked at it again but he could think of nothing better to say than his first remark it was the best butter you knowalice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity what a funny watch she remarked it tells the day of the month and doesnt tell what oclock it iswhy should it muttered the hatter does your watch tell you what year it isof course not alice replied very readily but thats because it stays the same year for such a long time togetherwhich is just the case with mine said the hatteralice felt dreadfully puzzled the hatters remark seemed to have no sort of meaning in it and yet it was certainly english i dont quite understand you she said as politely as she couldthe dormouse is asleep again said the hatter and he poured a little hot tea upon its nosethe dormouse shook its head impatiently and said without opening its eyes of course of course just what i was going to remark myselfhave you guessed the riddle yet the hatter said turning to alice againno i give it up alice replied whats the answeri havent the slightest idea said the hatternor i said the march harealice sighed wearily i think you might do something better with the time she said than waste it in asking riddles that have no answersif you knew time as well as i do said the hatter you wouldnt talk about wasting it its himi dont know what you mean said aliceof course you dont the hatter said tossing his head contemptuously i dare say you never even spoke to timeperhaps not alice cautiously replied but i know i have to beat time when i learn musicah that accounts for it said the hatter he wont stand beating now if you only kept on good terms with him hed do almost anything you liked with the clock for instance suppose it were nine oclock in the morning just time to begin lessons youd only have to whisper a hint to time and round goes the clock in a twinkling halfpast one time for dinneri only wish it was the march hare said to itself in a whisperthat would be grand certainly said alice thoughtfully but theni shouldnt be hungry for it you knownot at first perhaps said the hatter but you could keep it to halfpast one as long as you likedis that the way you manage alice askedthe hatter shook his head mournfully not i he replied we quarrelled last marchjust before he went mad you know pointing with his tea spoon at the march hare it was at the great concert given by the queen of hearts and i had to singtwinkle twinkle little bathow i wonder what youre atyou know the song perhapsive heard something like it said aliceit goes on you know the hatter continued in this wayup above the world you flylike a teatray in the skytwinkle twinklehere the dormouse shook itself and began singing in its sleep twinkle twinkle twinkle twinkle and went on so long that they had to pinch it to make it stopwell id hardly finished the first verse said the hatter when the queen jumped up and bawled out hes murdering the time off with his headhow dreadfully savage exclaimed aliceand ever since that the hatter went on in a mournful tone he wont do a thing i ask its always six oclock nowa bright idea came into alices head is that the reason so many teathings are put out here she askedyes thats it said the hatter with a sigh its always teatime and weve no time to wash the things between whilesthen you keep moving round i suppose said aliceexactly so said the hatter as the things get used upbut what happens when you come to the beginning again alice ventured to asksuppose we change the subject the march hare interrupted yawning im getting tired of this i vote the young lady tells us a storyim afraid i dont know one said alice rather alarmed at the proposalthen the dormouse shall they both cried wake up dormouse and they pinched it on both sides at oncethe dormouse slowly opened his eyes i wasnt asleep he said in a hoarse feeble voice i heard every word you fellows were sayingtell us a story said the march hareyes please do pleaded aliceand be quick about it added the hatter or youll be asleep again before its doneonce upon a time there were three little sisters the dormouse began in a great hurry and their names were elsie lacie and tillie and they lived at the bottom of a wellwhat did they live on said alice who always took a great interest in questions of eating and drinkingthey lived on treacle said the dormouse after thinking a minute or twothey couldnt have done that you know alice gently remarked theyd have been illso they were said the dormouse very illalice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways of living would be like but it puzzled her too much so she went on but why did they live at the bottom of a welltake some more tea the march hare said to alice very earnestlyive had nothing yet alice replied in an offended tone so i cant take moreyou mean you cant take less said the hatter its very easy to take more than nothingnobody asked your opinion said alicewhos making personal remarks now the hatter asked triumphantlyalice did not quite know what to say to this so she helped herself to some tea and breadandbutter and then turned to the dormouse and repeated her question why did they live at the bottom of a wellthe dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it and then said it was a treaclewelltheres no such thing alice was beginning very angrily but the hatter and the march hare went sh sh and the dormouse sulkily remarked if you cant be civil youd better finish the story for yourselfno please go on alice said very humbly i wont interrupt again i dare say there may be oneone indeed said the dormouse indignantly however he consented to go on and so these three little sistersthey were learning to draw you knowwhat did they draw said alice quite forgetting her promisetreacle said the dormouse without considering at all this timei want a clean cup interrupted the hatter lets all move one place onhe moved on as he spoke and the dormouse followed him the march hare moved into the dormouses place and alice rather unwillingly took the place of the march hare the hatter was the only one who got any advantage from the change and alice was a good deal worse off than before as the march hare had just upset the milkjug into his platealice did not wish to offend the dormouse again so she began very cautiously but i dont understand where did they draw the treacle fromyou can draw water out of a waterwell said the hatter so i should think you could draw treacle out of a treaclewelleh stupidbut they were in the well alice said to the dormouse not choosing to notice this last remarkof course they were said the dormouse well inthis answer so confused poor alice that she let the dormouse go on for some time without interrupting itthey were learning to draw the dormouse went on yawning and rubbing its eyes for it was getting very sleepy and they drew all manner of thingseverything that begins with an mwhy with an m said alicewhy not said the march harealice was silentthe dormouse had closed its eyes by this time and was going off into a doze but on being pinched by the hatter it woke up again with a little shriek and went on that begins with an m such as mousetraps and the moon and memory and muchness you know you say things are much of a muchnessdid you ever see such a thing as a drawing of a muchnessreally now you ask me said alice very much confused i dont thinkthen you shouldnt talk said the hatterthis piece of rudeness was more than alice could bear she got up in great disgust and walked off the dormouse fell asleep instantly and neither of the others took the least notice of her going though she looked back once or twice half hoping that they would call after her the last time she saw them they were trying to put the dormouse into the teapotat any rate ill never go there again said alice as she picked her way through the wood its the stupidest teaparty i ever was at in all my lifejust as she said this she noticed that one of the trees had a door leading right into it thats very curious she thought but everythings curious today i think i may as well go in at once and in she wentonce more she found herself in the long hall and close to the little glass table now ill manage better this time she said to herself and began by taking the little golden key and unlocking the door that led into the garden then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom she had kept a piece of it in her pocket till she was about a foot high then she walked down the little passage and thenshe found herself at last in the beautiful garden among the bright flowerbeds and the cool fountainschapter viiithe queens croquetgrounda large rosetree stood near the entrance of the garden the roses growing on it were white but there were three gardeners at it busily painting them red alice thought this a very curious thing and she went nearer to watch them and just as she came up to them she heard one of them say look out now five dont go splashing paint over me like thati couldnt help it said five in a sulky tone seven jogged my elbowon which seven looked up and said thats right five always lay the blame on othersyoud better not talk said five i heard the queen say only yesterday you deserved to be beheadedwhat for said the one who had spoken firstthats none of your business two said sevenyes it is his business said five and ill tell himit was for bringing the cook tuliproots instead of onionsseven flung down his brush and had just begun well of all the unjust things when his eye chanced to fall upon alice as she stood watching them and he checked himself suddenly the others looked round also and all of them bowed lowwould you tell me said alice a little timidly why you are painting those rosesfive and seven said nothing but looked at two two began in a low voice why the fact is you see miss this here ought to have been a red rosetree and we put a white one in by mistake and if the queen was to find it out we should all have our heads cut off you know so you see miss were doing our best afore she comes to at this moment five who had been anxiously looking across the garden called out the queen the queen and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon their faces there was a sound of many footsteps and alice looked round eager to see the queenfirst came ten soldiers carrying clubs these were all shaped like the three gardeners oblong and flat with their hands and feet at the corners next the ten courtiers these were ornamented all over with diamonds and walked two and two as the soldiers did after these came the royal children there were ten of them and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand in hand in couples they were all ornamented with hearts next came the guests mostly kings and queens and among them alice recognised the white rabbit it was talking in a hurried nervous manner smiling at everything that was said and went by without noticing her then followed the knave of hearts carrying the kings crown on a crimson velvet cushion and last of all this grand procession came the king and queen of heartsalice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face like the three gardeners but she could not remember ever having heard of such a rule at processions and besides what would be the use of a procession thought she if people had all to lie down upon their faces so that they couldnt see it so she stood still where she was and waitedwhen the procession came opposite to alice they all stopped and looked at her and the queen said severely who is this she said it to the knave of hearts who only bowed and smiled in replyidiot said the queen tossing her head impatiently and turning to alice she went on whats your name childmy name is alice so please your majesty said alice very politely but she added to herself why theyre only a pack of cards after all i neednt be afraid of themand who are these said the queen pointing to the three gardeners who were lying round the rosetree for you see as they were lying on their faces and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of the pack she could not tell whether they were gardeners or soldiers or courtiers or three of her own childrenhow should i know said alice surprised at her own courage its no business of minethe queen turned crimson with fury and after glaring at her for a moment like a wild beast screamed off with her head offnonsense said alice very loudly and decidedly and the queen was silentthe king laid his hand upon her arm and timidly said consider my dear she is only a childthe queen turned angrily away from him and said to the knave turn them overthe knave did so very carefully with one footget up said the queen in a shrill loud voice and the three gardeners instantly jumped up and began bowing to the king the queen the royal children and everybody elseleave off that screamed the queen you make me giddy and then turning to the rosetree she went on what have you been doing heremay it please your majesty said two in a very humble tone going down on one knee as he spoke we were tryingi see said the queen who had meanwhile been examining the roses off with their heads and the procession moved on three of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners who ran to alice for protectionyou shant be beheaded said alice and she put them into a large flowerpot that stood near the three soldiers wandered about for a minute or two looking for them and then quietly marched off after the othersare their heads off shouted the queentheir heads are gone if it please your majesty the soldiers shouted in replythats right shouted the queen can you play croquetthe soldiers were silent and looked at alice as the question was evidently meant for heryes shouted alicecome on then roared the queen and alice joined the procession wondering very much what would happen nextitsits a very fine day said a timid voice at her side she was walking by the white rabbit who was peeping anxiously into her facevery said alice wheres the duchesshush hush said the rabbit in a low hurried tone he looked anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke and then raised himself upon tiptoe put his mouth close to her ear and whispered shes under sentence of executionwhat for said alicedid you say what a pity the rabbit askedno i didnt said alice i dont think its at all a pity i said what forshe boxed the queens ears the rabbit began alice gave a little scream of laughter oh hush the rabbit whispered in a frightened tone the queen will hear you you see she came rather late and the queen saidget to your places shouted the queen in a voice of thunder and people began running about in all directions tumbling up against each other however they got settled down in a minute or two and the game began alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquetground in her life it was all ridges and furrows the balls were live hedgehogs the mallets live flamingoes and the soldiers had to double themselves up and to stand on their hands and feet to make the archesthe chief difficulty alice found at first was in managing her flamingo she succeeded in getting its body tucked away comfortably enough under her arm with its legs hanging down but generally just as she had got its neck nicely straightened out and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head it would twist itself round and look up in her face with such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing and when she had got its head down and was going to begin again it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled itself and was in the act of crawling away besides all this there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she wanted to send the hedgehog to and as the doubledup soldiers were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeedthe players all played at once without waiting for turns quarrelling all the while and fighting for the hedgehogs and in a very short time the queen was in a furious passion and went stamping about and shouting off with his head or off with her head about once in a minutealice began to feel very uneasy to be sure she had not as yet had any dispute with the queen but she knew that it might happen any minute and then thought she what would become of me theyre dreadfully fond of beheading people here the great wonder is that theres any one left aliveshe was looking about for some way of escape and wondering whether she could get away without being seen when she noticed a curious appearance in the air it puzzled her very much at first but after watching it a minute or two she made it out to be a grin and she said to herself its the cheshire cat now i shall have somebody to talk tohow are you getting on said the cat as soon as there was mouth enough for it to speak withalice waited till the eyes appeared and then nodded its no use speaking to it she thought till its ears have come or at least one of them in another minute the whole head appeared and then alice put down her flamingo and began an account of the game feeling very glad she had someone to listen to her the cat seemed to think that there was enough of it now in sight and no more of it appearedi dont think they play at all fairly alice began in rather a complaining tone and they all quarrel so dreadfully one cant hear oneself speakand they dont seem to have any rules in particular at least if there are nobody attends to themand youve no idea how confusing it is all the things being alive for instance theres the arch ive got to go through next walking about at the other end of the groundand i should have croqueted the queens hedgehog just now only it ran away when it saw mine cominghow do you like the queen said the cat in a low voicenot at all said alice shes so extremely just then she noticed that the queen was close behind her listening so she went on likely to win that its hardly worth while finishing the gamethe queen smiled and passed onwho are you talking to said the king going up to alice and looking at the cats head with great curiosityits a friend of minea cheshire cat said alice allow me to introduce iti dont like the look of it at all said the king however it may kiss my hand if it likesid rather not the cat remarkeddont be impertinent said the king and dont look at me like that he got behind alice as he spokea cat may look at a king said alice ive read that in some book but i dont remember wherewell it must be removed said the king very decidedly and he called the queen who was passing at the moment my dear i wish you would have this cat removedthe queen had only one way of settling all difficulties great or small off with his head she said without even looking roundill fetch the executioner myself said the king eagerly and he hurried offalice thought she might as well go back and see how the game was going on as she heard the queens voice in the distance screaming with passion she had already heard her sentence three of the players to be executed for having missed their turns and she did not like the look of things at all as the game was in such confusion that she never knew whether it was her turn or not so she went in search of her hedgehogthe hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog which seemed to alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the other the only difficulty was that her flamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden where alice could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up into a treeby the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back the fight was over and both the hedgehogs were out of sight but it doesnt matter much thought alice as all the arches are gone from this side of the ground so she tucked it away under her arm that it might not escape again and went back for a little more conversation with her friendwhen she got back to the cheshire cat she was surprised to find quite a large crowd collected round it there was a dispute going on between the executioner the king and the queen who were all talking at once while all the rest were quite silent and looked very uncomfortablethe moment alice appeared she was appealed to by all three to settle the question and they repeated their arguments to her though as they all spoke at once she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly what they saidthe executioners argument was that you couldnt cut off a head unless there was a body to cut it off from that he had never had to do such a thing before and he wasnt going to begin at his time of lifethe kings argument was that anything that had a head could be beheaded and that you werent to talk nonsensethe queens argument was that if something wasnt done about it in less than no time shed have everybody executed all round it was this last remark that had made the whole party look so grave and anxiousalice could think of nothing else to say but it belongs to the duchess youd better ask her about itshes in prison the queen said to the executioner fetch her here and the executioner went off like an arrowthe cats head began fading away the moment he was gone and by the time he had come back with the duchess it had entirely disappeared so the king and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it while the rest of the party went back to the gamechapter ixthe mock turtles storyyou cant think how glad i am to see you again you dear old thing said the duchess as she tucked her arm affectionately into alices and they walked off togetheralice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper and thought to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so savage when they met in the kitchenwhen im a duchess she said to herself not in a very hopeful tone though i wont have any pepper in my kitchen at all soup does very well withoutmaybe its always pepper that makes people hottempered she went on very much pleased at having found out a new kind of rule and vinegar that makes them sourand camomile that makes them bitterandand barleysugar and such things that make children sweettempered i only wish people knew that then they wouldnt be so stingy about it you knowshe had quite forgotten the duchess by this time and was a little startled when she heard her voice close to her ear youre thinking about something my dear and that makes you forget to talk i cant tell you just now what the moral of that is but i shall remember it in a bitperhaps it hasnt one alice ventured to remarktut tut child said the duchess everythings got a moral if only you can find it and she squeezed herself up closer to alices side as she spokealice did not much like keeping so close to her first because the duchess was very ugly and secondly because she was exactly the right height to rest her chin upon alices shoulder and it was an uncomfortably sharp chin however she did not like to be rude so she bore it as well as she couldthe games going on rather better now she said by way of keeping up the conversation a littletis so said the duchess and the moral of that isoh tis love tis love that makes the world go roundsomebody said alice whispered that its done by everybody minding their own businessah well it means much the same thing said the duchess digging her sharp little chin into alices shoulder as she added and the moral of that istake care of the sense and the sounds will take care of themselveshow fond she is of finding morals in things alice thought to herselfi dare say youre wondering why i dont put my arm round your waist the duchess said after a pause the reason is that im doubtful about the temper of your flamingo shall i try the experimenthe might bite alice cautiously replied not feeling at all anxious to have the experiment triedvery true said the duchess flamingoes and mustard both bite and the moral of that isbirds of a feather flock togetheronly mustard isnt a bird alice remarkedright as usual said the duchess what a clear way you have of putting thingsits a mineral i think said aliceof course it is said the duchess who seemed ready to agree to everything that alice said theres a large mustardmine near here and the moral of that isthe more there is of mine the less there is of yoursoh i know exclaimed alice who had not attended to this last remark its a vegetable it doesnt look like one but it isi quite agree with you said the duchess and the moral of that isbe what you would seem to beor if youd like it put more simplynever imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might appear to others that what you were or might have been was not otherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be otherwisei think i should understand that better alice said very politely if i had it written down but i cant quite follow it as you say itthats nothing to what i could say if i chose the duchess replied in a pleased tonepray dont trouble yourself to say it any longer than that said aliceoh dont talk about trouble said the duchess i make you a present of everything ive said as yeta cheap sort of present thought alice im glad they dont give birthday presents like that but she did not venture to say it out loudthinking again the duchess asked with another dig of her sharp little chinive a right to think said alice sharply for she was beginning to feel a little worriedjust about as much right said the duchess as pigs have to fly and the mbut here to alices great surprise the duchesss voice died away even in the middle of her favourite word moral and the arm that was linked into hers began to tremble alice looked up and there stood the queen in front of them with her arms folded frowning like a thunderstorma fine day your majesty the duchess began in a low weak voicenow i give you fair warning shouted the queen stamping on the ground as she spoke either you or your head must be off and that in about half no time take your choicethe duchess took her choice and was gone in a momentlets go on with the game the queen said to alice and alice was too much frightened to say a word but slowly followed her back to the croquetgroundthe other guests had taken advantage of the queens absence and were resting in the shade however the moment they saw her they hurried back to the game the queen merely remarking that a moments delay would cost them their livesall the time they were playing the queen never left off quarrelling with the other players and shouting off with his head or off with her head those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the soldiers who of course had to leave off being arches to do this so that by the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left and all the players except the king the queen and alice were in custody and under sentence of executionthen the queen left off quite out of breath and said to alice have you seen the mock turtle yetno said alice i dont even know what a mock turtle isits the thing mock turtle soup is made from said the queeni never saw one or heard of one said alicecome on then said the queen and he shall tell you his historyas they walked off together alice heard the king say in a low voice to the company generally you are all pardoned come thats a good thing she said to herself for she had felt quite unhappy at the number of executions the queen had orderedthey very soon came upon a gryphon lying fast asleep in the sun if you dont know what a gryphon is look at the picture up lazy thing said the queen and take this young lady to see the mock turtle and to hear his history i must go back and see after some executions i have ordered and she walked off leaving alice alone with the gryphon alice did not quite like the look of the creature but on the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it as to go after that savage queen so she waitedthe gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes then it watched the queen till she was out of sight then it chuckled what fun said the gryphon half to itself half to alicewhat is the fun said alicewhy she said the gryphon its all her fancy that they never executes nobody you know come oneverybody says come on here thought alice as she went slowly after it i never was so ordered about in all my life neverthey had not gone far before they saw the mock turtle in the distance sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock and as they came nearer alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break she pitied him deeply what is his sorrow she asked the gryphon and the gryphon answered very nearly in the same words as before its all his fancy that he hasnt got no sorrow you know come onso they went up to the mock turtle who looked at them with large eyes full of tears but said nothingthis here young lady said the gryphon she wants for to know your history she doill tell it her said the mock turtle in a deep hollow tone sit down both of you and dont speak a word till ive finishedso they sat down and nobody spoke for some minutes alice thought to herself i dont see how he can even finish if he doesnt begin but she waited patientlyonce said the mock turtle at last with a deep sigh i was a real turtlethese words were followed by a very long silence broken only by an occasional exclamation of hjckrrh from the gryphon and the constant heavy sobbing of the mock turtle alice was very nearly getting up and saying thank you sir for your interesting story but she could not help thinking there must be more to come so she sat still and said nothingwhen we were little the mock turtle went on at last more calmly though still sobbing a little now and then we went to school in the sea the master was an old turtlewe used to call him tortoisewhy did you call him tortoise if he wasnt one alice askedwe called him tortoise because he taught us said the mock turtle angrily really you are very dullyou ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question added the gryphon and then they both sat silent and looked at poor alice who felt ready to sink into the earth at last the gryphon said to the mock turtle drive on old fellow dont be all day about it and he went on in these wordsyes we went to school in the sea though you maynt believe iti never said i didnt interrupted aliceyou did said the mock turtlehold your tongue added the gryphon before alice could speak again the mock turtle went onwe had the best of educationsin fact we went to school every dayive been to a dayschool too said alice you neednt be so proud as all thatwith extras asked the mock turtle a little anxiouslyyes said alice we learned french and musicand washing said the mock turtlecertainly not said alice indignantlyah then yours wasnt a really good school said the mock turtle in a tone of great relief now at ours they had at the end of the bill french music and washingextrayou couldnt have wanted it much said alice living at the bottom of the seai couldnt afford to learn it said the mock turtle with a sigh i only took the regular coursewhat was that inquired alicereeling and writhing of course to begin with the mock turtle replied and then the different branches of arithmetic ambition distraction uglification and derisioni never heard of uglification alice ventured to say what is itthe gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise what never heard of uglifying it exclaimed you know what to beautify is i supposeyes said alice doubtfully it meanstomakeanythingprettierwell then the gryphon went on if you dont know what to uglify is you are a simpletonalice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it so she turned to the mock turtle and said what else had you to learnwell there was mystery the mock turtle replied counting off the subjects on his flappers mystery ancient and modern with seaography then drawlingthe drawlingmaster was an old congereel that used to come once a week he taught us drawling stretching and fainting in coilswhat was that like said alicewell i cant show it you myself the mock turtle said im too stiff and the gryphon never learnt ithadnt time said the gryphon i went to the classics master though he was an old crab he wasi never went to him the mock turtle said with a sigh he taught laughing and grief they used to sayso he did so he did said the gryphon sighing in his turn and both creatures hid their faces in their pawsand how many hours a day did you do lessons said alice in a hurry to change the subjectten hours the first day said the mock turtle nine the next and so onwhat a curious plan exclaimed alicethats the reason theyre called lessons the gryphon remarked because they lessen from day to daythis was quite a new idea to alice and she thought it over a little before she made her next remark then the eleventh day must have been a holidayof course it was said the mock turtleand how did you manage on the twelfth alice went on eagerlythats enough about lessons the gryphon interrupted in a very decided tone tell her something about the games nowchapter xthe lobster quadrillethe mock turtle sighed deeply and drew the back of one flapper across his eyes he looked at alice and tried to speak but for a minute or two sobs choked his voice same as if he had a bone in his throat said the gryphon and it set to work shaking him and punching him in the back at last the mock turtle recovered his voice and with tears running down his cheeks he went on againyou may not have lived much under the sea i havent said alice and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster alice began to say i once tasted but checked herself hastily and said no never so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a lobster quadrille isno indeed said alice what sort of a dance is itwhy said the gryphon you first form into a line along the seashoretwo lines cried the mock turtle seals turtles salmon and so on then when youve cleared all the jellyfish out of the waythat generally takes some time interrupted the gryphonyou advance twiceeach with a lobster as a partner cried the gryphonof course the mock turtle said advance twice set to partnerschange lobsters and retire in same order continued the gryphonthen you know the mock turtle went on you throw thethe lobsters shouted the gryphon with a bound into the airas far out to sea as you canswim after them screamed the gryphonturn a somersault in the sea cried the mock turtle capering wildly aboutchange lobsters again yelled the gryphon at the top of its voiceback to land again and thats all the first figure said the mock turtle suddenly dropping his voice and the two creatures who had been jumping about like mad things all this time sat down again very sadly and quietly and looked at aliceit must be a very pretty dance said alice timidlywould you like to see a little of it said the mock turtlevery much indeed said alicecome lets try the first figure said the mock turtle to the gryphon we can do without lobsters you know which shall singoh you sing said the gryphon ive forgotten the wordsso they began solemnly dancing round and round alice every now and then treading on her toes when they passed too close and waving their forepaws to mark the time while the mock turtle sang this very slowly and sadlywill you walk a little faster said a whiting to a snail theres a porpoise close behind us and hes treading on my tail see how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance they are waiting on the shinglewill you come and join the dancewill you wont you will you wont you will you join the dance will you wont you will you wont you wont you join the danceyou can really have no notion how delightful it will be when they take us up and throw us with the lobsters out to sea but the snail replied too far too far and gave a look askance said he thanked the whiting kindly but he would not join the dance would not could not would not could not would not join the dance would not could not would not could not could not join the dancewhat matters it how far we go his scaly friend replied there is another shore you know upon the other side the further off from england the nearer is to france then turn not pale beloved snail but come and join the dancewill you wont you will you wont you will you join the dance will you wont you will you wont you wont you join the dancethank you its a very interesting dance to watch said alice feeling very glad that it was over at last and i do so like that curious song about the whitingoh as to the whiting said the mock turtle theyyouve seen them of courseyes said alice ive often seen them at dinn she checked herself hastilyi dont know where dinn may be said the mock turtle but if youve seen them so often of course you know what theyre likei believe so alice replied thoughtfully they have their tails in their mouthsand theyre all over crumbsyoure wrong about the crumbs said the mock turtle crumbs would all wash off in the sea but they have their tails in their mouths and the reason is here the mock turtle yawned and shut his eyestell her about the reason and all that he said to the gryphonthe reason is said the gryphon that they would go with the lobsters to the dance so they got thrown out to sea so they had to fall a long way so they got their tails fast in their mouths so they couldnt get them out again thats allthank you said alice its very interesting i never knew so much about a whiting beforei can tell you more than that if you like said the gryphon do you know why its called a whitingi never thought about it said alice whyit does the boots and shoes the gryphon replied very solemnlyalice was thoroughly puzzled does the boots and shoes she repeated in a wondering tonewhy what are your shoes done with said the gryphon i mean what makes them so shinyalice looked down at them and considered a little before she gave her answer theyre done with blacking i believeboots and shoes under the sea the gryphon went on in a deep voice are done with a whiting now you knowand what are they made of alice asked in a tone of great curiositysoles and eels of course the gryphon replied rather impatiently any shrimp could have told you thatif id been the whiting said alice whose thoughts were still running on the song id have said to the porpoise keep back please we dont want you with usthey were obliged to have him with them the mock turtle said no wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoisewouldnt it really said alice in a tone of great surpriseof course not said the mock turtle why if a fish came to me and told me he was going a journey i should say with what porpoisedont you mean purpose said alicei mean what i say the mock turtle replied in an offended tone and the gryphon added come lets hear some of your adventuresi could tell you my adventuresbeginning from this morning said alice a little timidly but its no use going back to yesterday because i was a different person thenexplain all that said the mock turtleno no the adventures first said the gryphon in an impatient tone explanations take such a dreadful timeso alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first saw the white rabbit she was a little nervous about it just at first the two creatures got so close to her one on each side and opened their eyes and mouths so very wide but she gained courage as she went on her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part about her repeating you are old father william to the caterpillar and the words all coming different and then the mock turtle drew a long breath and said thats very curiousits all about as curious as it can be said the gryphonit all came different the mock turtle repeated thoughtfully i should like to hear her try and repeat something now tell her to begin he looked at the gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of authority over alicestand up and repeat tis the voice of the sluggard said the gryphonhow the creatures order one about and make one repeat lessons thought alice i might as well be at school at once however she got up and began to repeat it but her head was so full of the lobster quadrille that she hardly knew what she was saying and the words came very queer indeedtis the voice of the lobster i heard him declare you have baked me too brown i must sugar my hair as a duck with its eyelids so he with his nose trims his belt and his buttons and turns out his toeslater editions continued as follows when the sands are all dry he is gay as a lark and will talk in contemptuous tones of the shark but when the tide rises and sharks are around his voice has a timid and tremulous soundthats different from what i used to say when i was a child said the gryphonwell i never heard it before said the mock turtle but it sounds uncommon nonsensealice said nothing she had sat down with her face in her hands wondering if anything would ever happen in a natural way againi should like to have it explained said the mock turtleshe cant explain it said the gryphon hastily go on with the next versebut about his toes the mock turtle persisted how could he turn them out with his nose you knowits the first position in dancing alice said but was dreadfully puzzled by the whole thing and longed to change the subjectgo on with the next verse the gryphon repeated impatiently it begins i passed by his gardenalice did not dare to disobey though she felt sure it would all come wrong and she went on in a trembling voicei passed by his garden and marked with one eye how the owl and the panther were sharing a pielater editions continued as follows the panther took piecrust and gravy and meat while the owl had the dish as its share of the treat when the pie was all finished the owl as a boon was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon while the panther received knife and fork with a growl and concluded the banquetwhat is the use of repeating all that stuff the mock turtle interrupted if you dont explain it as you go on its by far the most confusing thing i ever heardyes i think youd better leave off said the gryphon and alice was only too glad to do soshall we try another figure of the lobster quadrille the gryphon went on or would you like the mock turtle to sing you a songoh a song please if the mock turtle would be so kind alice replied so eagerly that the gryphon said in a rather offended tone hm no accounting for tastes sing her turtle soup will you old fellowthe mock turtle sighed deeply and began in a voice sometimes choked with sobs to sing thisbeautiful soup so rich and green waiting in a hot tureen who for such dainties would not stoop soup of the evening beautiful soup soup of the evening beautiful soup

to repeat it when a cry of the trials beginning was heard in the distancecome on cried the gryphon and taking alice by the hand it hurried off without waiting for the end of the songwhat trial is it alice panted as she ran but the gryphon only answered come on and ran the faster while more and more faintly came carried on the breeze that followed them the melancholy wordssoooop of the eeevening beautiful beautiful soupchapter xiwho stole the tartsthe king and queen of hearts were seated on their throne when they arrived with a great crowd assembled about themall sorts of little birds and beasts as well as the whole pack of cards the knave was standing before them in chains with a soldier on each side to guard him and near the king was the white rabbit with a trumpet in one hand and a scroll of parchment in the other in the very middle of the court was a table with a large dish of tarts upon it they looked so good that it made alice quite hungry to look at themi wish theyd get the trial done she thought and hand round the refreshments but there seemed to be no chance of this so she began looking at everything about her to pass away the timealice had never been in a court of justice before but she had read about them in books and she was quite pleased to find that she knew the name of nearly everything there thats the judge she said to herself because of his great wigthe judge by the way was the king and as he wore his crown over the wig look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it he did not look at all comfortable and it was certainly not becomingand thats the jurybox thought alice and those twelve creatures she was obliged to say creatures you see because some of them were animals and some were birds i suppose they are the jurors she said this last word two or three times over to herself being rather proud of it for she thought and rightly too that very few little girls of her age knew the meaning of it at all however jurymen would have done just as wellthe twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates what are they doing alice whispered to the gryphon they cant have anything to put down yet before the trials beguntheyre putting down their names the gryphon whispered in reply for fear they should forget them before the end of the trialstupid things alice began in a loud indignant voice but she stopped hastily for the white rabbit cried out silence in the court and the king put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round to make out who was talkingalice could see as well as if she were looking over their shoulders that all the jurors were writing down stupid things on their slates and she could even make out that one of them didnt know how to spell stupid and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him a nice muddle their slatesll be in before the trials over thought aliceone of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked this of course alice could not stand and she went round the court and got behind him and very soon found an opportunity of taking it away she did it so quickly that the poor little juror it was bill the lizard could not make out at all what had become of it so after hunting all about for it he was obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day and this was of very little use as it left no mark on the slateherald read the accusation said the kingon this the white rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet and then unrolled the parchment scroll and read as followsthe queen of hearts she made some tarts all on a summer day the knave of hearts he stole those tarts and took them quite awayconsider your verdict the king said to the jurynot yet not yet the rabbit hastily interrupted theres a great deal to come before thatcall the first witness said the king and the white rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet and called out first witnessthe first witness was the hatter he came in with a teacup in one hand and a piece of breadandbutter in the other i beg pardon your majesty he began for bringing these in but i hadnt quite finished my tea when i was sent foryou ought to have finished said the king when did you beginthe hatter looked at the march hare who had followed him into the court arminarm with the dormouse fourteenth of march i think it was he saidfifteenth said the march haresixteenth added the dormousewrite that down the king said to the jury and the jury eagerly wrote down all three dates on their slates and then added them up and reduced the answer to shillings and pencetake off your hat the king said to the hatterit isnt mine said the hatterstolen the king exclaimed turning to the jury who instantly made a memorandum of the facti keep them to sell the hatter added as an explanation ive none of my own im a hatterhere the queen put on her spectacles and began staring at the hatter who turned pale and fidgetedgive your evidence said the king and dont be nervous or ill have you executed on the spotthis did not seem to encourage the witness at all he kept shifting from one foot to the other looking uneasily at the queen and in his confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the breadandbutterjust at this moment alice felt a very curious sensation which puzzled her a good deal until she made out what it was she was beginning to grow larger again and she thought at first she would get up and leave the court but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was as long as there was room for heri wish you wouldnt squeeze so said the dormouse who was sitting next to her i can hardly breathei cant help it said alice very meekly im growingyouve no right to grow here said the dormousedont talk nonsense said alice more boldly you know youre growing tooyes but i grow at a reasonable pace said the dormouse not in that ridiculous fashion and he got up very sulkily and crossed over to the other side of the courtall this time the queen had never left off staring at the hatter and just as the dormouse crossed the court she said to one of the officers of the court bring me the list of the singers in the last concert on which the wretched hatter trembled so that he shook both his shoes offgive your evidence the king repeated angrily or ill have you executed whether youre nervous or notim a poor man your majesty the hatter began in a trembling voice and i hadnt begun my teanot above a week or soand what with the breadandbutter getting so thinand the twinkling of the teathe twinkling of the what said the kingit began with the tea the hatter repliedof course twinkling begins with a t said the king sharply do you take me for a dunce go onim a poor man the hatter went on and most things twinkled after thatonly the march hare saidi didnt the march hare interrupted in a great hurryyou did said the hatteri deny it said the march harehe denies it said the king leave out that partwell at any rate the dormouse said the hatter went on looking anxiously round to see if he would deny it too but the dormouse denied nothing being fast asleepafter that continued the hatter i cut some more bread andbutterbut what did the dormouse say one of the jury askedthat i cant remember said the hatteryou must remember remarked the king or ill have you executedthe miserable hatter dropped his teacup and breadandbutter and went down on one knee im a poor man your majesty he beganyoure a very poor speaker said the kinghere one of the guineapigs cheered and was immediately suppressed by the officers of the court as that is rather a hard word i will just explain to you how it was done they had a large canvas bag which tied up at the mouth with strings into this they slipped the guineapig head first and then sat upon itim glad ive seen that done thought alice ive so often read in the newspapers at the end of trials there was some attempts at applause which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the court and i never understood what it meant till nowif thats all you know about it you may stand down continued the kingi cant go no lower said the hatter im on the floor as it isthen you may sit down the king repliedhere the other guineapig cheered and was suppressedcome that finished the guineapigs thought alice now we shall get on betterid rather finish my tea said the hatter with an anxious look at the queen who was reading the list of singersyou may go said the king and the hatter hurriedly left the court without even waiting to put his shoes onand just take his head off outside the queen added to one of the officers but the hatter was out of sight before the officer could get to the doorcall the next witness said the kingthe next witness was the duchesss cook she carried the pepperbox in her hand and alice guessed who it was even before she got into the court by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at oncegive your evidence said the kingshant said the cookthe king looked anxiously at the white rabbit who said in a low voice your majesty must crossexamine this witnesswell if i must i must the king said with a melancholy air and after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till his eyes were nearly out of sight he said in a deep voice what are tarts made ofpepper mostly said the cooktreacle said a sleepy voice behind hercollar that dormouse the queen shrieked out behead that dormouse turn that dormouse out of court suppress him pinch him off with his whiskersfor some minutes the whole court was in confusion getting the dormouse turned out and by the time they had settled down again the cook had disappearednever mind said the king with an air of great relief call the next witness and he added in an undertone to the queen really my dear you must crossexamine the next witness it quite makes my forehead achealice watched the white rabbit as he fumbled over the list feeling very curious to see what the next witness would be like for they havent got much evidence yet she said to herself imagine her surprise when the white rabbit read out at the top of his shrill little voice the name alicechapter xiialices evidencehere cried alice quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how large she had grown in the last few minutes and she jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over the jurybox with the edge of her skirt upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below and there they lay sprawling about reminding her very much of a globe of goldfish she had accidentally upset the week beforeoh i beg your pardon she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay and began picking them up again as quickly as she could for the accident of the goldfish kept running in her head and she had a vague sort of idea that they must be collected at once and put back into the jurybox or they would diethe trial cannot proceed said the king in a very grave voice until all the jurymen are back in their proper places all he repeated with great emphasis looking hard at alice as he said doalice looked at the jurybox and saw that in her haste she had put the lizard in head downwards and the poor little thing was waving its tail about in a melancholy way being quite unable to move she soon got it out again and put it right not that it signifies much she said to herself i should think it would be quite as much use in the trial one way up as the otheras soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being upset and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to them they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the accident all except the lizard who seemed too much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open gazing up into the roof of the courtwhat do you know about this business the king said to alicenothing said alicenothing whatever persisted the kingnothing whatever said alicethats very important the king said turning to the jury they were just beginning to write this down on their slates when the white rabbit interrupted unimportant your majesty means of course he said in a very respectful tone but frowning and making faces at him as he spokeunimportant of course i meant the king hastily said and went on to himself in an undertone importantunimportant unimportantimportant as if he were trying which word sounded bestsome of the jury wrote it down important and some unimportant alice could see this as she was near enough to look over their slates but it doesnt matter a bit she thought to herselfat this moment the king who had been for some time busily writing in his notebook cackled out silence and read out from his book rule fortytwo all persons more than a mile high to leave the courteverybody looked at aliceim not a mile high said aliceyou are said the kingnearly two miles high added the queenwell i shant go at any rate said alice besides thats not a regular rule you invented it just nowits the oldest rule in the book said the kingthen it ought to be number one said alicethe king turned pale and shut his notebook hastily consider your verdict he said to the jury in a low trembling voicetheres more evidence to come yet please your majesty said the white rabbit jumping up in a great hurry this paper has just been picked upwhats in it said the queeni havent opened it yet said the white rabbit but it seems to be a letter written by the prisoner toto somebodyit must have been that said the king unless it was written to nobody which isnt usual you knowwho is it directed to said one of the jurymenit isnt directed at all said the white rabbit in fact theres nothing written on the outside he unfolded the paper as he spoke and added it isnt a letter after all its a set of versesare they in the prisoners handwriting asked another of they jurymenno theyre not said the white rabbit and thats the queerest thing about it the jury all looked puzzledhe must have imitated somebody elses hand said the king the jury all brightened up againplease your majesty said the knave i didnt write it and they cant prove i did theres no name signed at the endif you didnt sign it said the king that only makes the matter worse you must have meant some mischief or else youd have signed your name like an honest manthere was a general clapping of hands at this it was the first really clever thing the king had said that daythat proves his guilt said the queenit proves nothing of the sort said alice why you dont even know what theyre aboutread them said the kingthe white rabbit put on his spectacles where shall i begin please your majesty he askedbegin at the beginning the king said gravely and go on till you come to the end then stopthese were the verses the white rabbit readthey told me you had been to her and mentioned me to him she gave me a good character but said i could not swimhe sent them word i had not gone we know it to be true if she should push the matter on what would become of youi gave her one they gave him two you gave us three or more they all returned from him to you though they were mine beforeif i or she should chance to be involved in this affair he trusts to you to set them free exactly as we weremy notion was that you had been before she had this fit an obstacle that came between him and ourselves and itdont let him know she liked them best for this must ever be a secret kept from all the rest between yourself and methats the most important piece of evidence weve heard yet said the king rubbing his hands so now let the juryif any one of them can explain it said alice she had grown so large in the last few minutes that she wasnt a bit afraid of interrupting him ill give him sixpence i dont believe theres an atom of meaning in itthe jury all wrote down on their slates she doesnt believe theres an atom of meaning in it but none of them attempted to explain the paperif theres no meaning in it said the king that saves a world of trouble you know as we neednt try to find any and yet i dont know he went on spreading out the verses on his knee and looking at them with one eye i seem to see some meaning in them after all said i could not swim you cant swim can you he added turning to the knavethe knave shook his head sadly do i look like it he said which he certainly did not being made entirely of cardboardall right so far said the king and he went on muttering over the verses to himself we know it to be true thats the jury of course i gave her one they gave him two why that must be what he did with the tarts you knowbut it goes on they all returned from him to you said alicewhy there they are said the king triumphantly pointing to the tarts on the table nothing can be clearer than that then againbefore she had this fit you never had fits my dear i think he said to the queennever said the queen furiously throwing an inkstand at the lizard as she spoke the unfortunate little bill had left off writing on his slate with one finger as he found it made no mark but he now hastily began again using the ink that was trickling down his face as long as it lastedthen the words dont fit you said the king looking round the court with a smile there was a dead silenceits a pun the king added in an offended tone and everybody laughed let the jury consider their verdict the king said for about the twentieth time that dayno no said the queen sentence firstverdict afterwardsstuff and nonsense said alice loudly the idea of having the sentence firsthold your tongue said the queen turning purplei wont said aliceoff with her head the queen shouted at the top of her voice nobody movedwho cares for you said alice she had grown to her full size by this time youre nothing but a pack of cardsat this the whole pack rose up into the air and came flying down upon her she gave a little scream half of fright and half of anger and tried to beat them off and found herself lying on the bank with her head in the lap of her sister who was gently brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her facewake up alice dear said her sister why what a long sleep youve hadoh ive had such a curious dream said alice and she told her sister as well as she could remember them all these strange adventures of hers that you have just been reading about and when she had finished her sister kissed her and said it was a curious dream dear certainly but now run in to your tea its getting late so alice got up and ran off thinking while she ran as well she might what a wonderful dream it had beenbut her sister sat still just as she left her leaning her head on her hand watching the setting sun and thinking of little alice and all her wonderful adventures till she too began dreaming after a fashion and this was her dreamfirst she dreamed of little alice herself and once again the tiny hands were clasped upon her knee and the bright eager eyes were looking up into hersshe could hear the very tones of her voice and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that would always get into her eyesand still as she listened or seemed to listen the whole place around her became alive the strange creatures of her little sisters dreamthe long grass rustled at her feet as the white rabbit hurried bythe frightened mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring poolshe could hear the rattle of the teacups as the march hare and his friends shared their neverending meal and the shrill voice of the queen ordering off her unfortunate guests to executiononce more the pigbaby was sneezing on the duchesss knee while plates and dishes crashed around itonce more the shriek of the gryphon the squeaking of the lizards slatepencil and the choking of the suppressed guineapigs filled the air mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable mock turtleso she sat on with closed eyes and half believed herself in wonderland though she knew she had but to open them again and all would change to dull realitythe grass would be only rustling in the wind and the pool rippling to the waving of the reedsthe rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheepbells and the queens shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd boyand the sneeze of the baby the shriek of the gryphon and all the other queer noises would change she knew to the confused clamour of the busy farmyardwhile the lowing of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the mock turtles heavy sobslastly she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers would in the aftertime be herself a grown woman and how she would keep through all her riper years the simple and loving heart of her childhood and how she would gather about her other little children and make their eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale perhaps even with the dream of wonderland of long ago and how she would feel with all their simple sorrows and find a pleasure in all their simple joys remembering her own childlife and the happy summer days
